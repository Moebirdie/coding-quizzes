# Coding Quiz Challenge

The Coding Quiz Challenge introduces the user to one of the methods potential employers may use to test the knowledge/skill level of a candidate applying for a position.  The creation of the quiz involved technical skills to demonstration various api methods including adding various elements to the webpage, including styling, saving and retrieving data from storage, for loops and arrays, and various other skills which have been learned this week. 

The GitHub repository for this challenge is: https://github.com/Moebirdie/coding-quizzes

The live quiz may be accessed by navigating to: https://moebirdie.github.io/coding-quizzes/


## Installation
For this example quiz, there is no installation necessary.  The test may be taken via access through a url.


## Usage
This quiz opens with an introduction to the scoring of the quiz; 10 points per correct answer and an 8 second time penalty for incorrect answers.  
When a user clicks on the start button, the following behavior can be seen:
- The timer begins counting down seconds from 78 seconds.  
- Questions are displayed with 4 choices in a multiple choice fashion.  
- As a user clicks a selection, the choice displays a visual indication of green for correct answers, and red for incorrect answers. 
- "Correct" or "Wrong" is also displayed at the bottom of the questions providing another visual indicator whether the answer is correct or incorrect.
- The next question will display after the result of the current question is displayed.
- There are a total of 6 questions that will display if time does not run out.
- Once time runs out, or all questions have been answered, a message "All Done!" will display.
- The user will have the opportunity to record their score along with their initials.
- The user can view their scores compared to other users by clicking the "View High Scores" button.
- The user also has the ability to reset all high scores.
- After viewing high scores, or after a game has completed, the user has the ability to take the quiz again.
- Questions are displayed in random order for each instance of the quiz so that answers can't be memorized without reading the questions.
